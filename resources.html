  <h1>Resources</h1> 
  <p> We have libraries that provide access to a wide range of books, scholarly journals, research papers, and digital resources.<br> Libraries often have dedicated sections for computer science and related disciplines
    offering resources for research, study, and reference purposes. The department typically has computer labs equipped with high-performance computers, specialized software, and tools necessary for computer science research and coursework.<br>
    These facilities provide students and researchers with access to the computing <br>resources they need to conduct experiments, develop software, and analyze data.
    The department has dedicated research centers and institutes focused on specific areas of computer science. These centers bring together faculty members,<br> researchers, and students with shared research interests, facilitating collaboration, funding opportunities,<br> and resources specific to those research areas.
    We often provide technical support services to assist with computer hardware, software, network connectivity, and other technical issues.
